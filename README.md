# Gradebook

The dream of the paperless classroom has been hard to realize. Not every student has computer access. Not every assignment can be done online. Gradebook aims to allow teachers to use less paper when the can't go paperless. Send out assignments and worksheets online. Have online assignments automatically marked. But have the flexibility to manually enter marks for part or all of assignments. 

This project is designed to integrate with Grade-it (a worksheet generator) and AutoMark (Automatically mark math worksheets from pictures).
